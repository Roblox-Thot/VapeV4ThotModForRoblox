(I will try to keep this updated with the root project)

Note:
I HIGHLY don't recommend using my fork as it will be modded more for what I want
and I will be removing a lot of things that may have been for safety of the accounts

Changes:
Addes FPS toggle 
Removes vxpe.xyz from auto toxic as it's tagged
Removed "whitelisted" wich makes it so you can't attack some people
Added reply to someone using the default death msg on Vape/this (I dont care your gaming chair, I care about how you are bad at cheating L NAMEHERE)

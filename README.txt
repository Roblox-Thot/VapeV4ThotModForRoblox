(I will try to keep this updated with the root project)

Note:
I don't recommend using my fork as it will be modded more for what I want

Changes:
Addes FPS toggle 
Removes vxpe.xyz from auto toxic as it's tagged
Removed "whitelisted" wich makes it so you can't attack some people
Added reply to someone using the default death msg on Vape/this (I dont care your gaming chair, I care about how you are bad at cheating L NAMEHERE)
